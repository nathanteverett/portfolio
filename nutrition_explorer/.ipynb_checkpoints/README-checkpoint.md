### A Datastory by Nathan T. Everett

The main program is in the jupyter notebook nutrition_explorer_australia.ipynb

Database: Australian Food Composition Database

### Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze commonly consumed foods and gain a deep understanding of their nutrition content. We are often told to eat a balanced diet and get most of our vitamins and minerals from food sources when possible. However, rarely does anyone track these micronutrients. I want to gain an understanding of how easy it is to satisfy the recommended requirements and understand which foods make this easier. By finding the most nutrient dense foods, foods that have the rarest nutrients, and what foods together complete our daily requirements, I hope to build a complete lifestyle diet for myself.

The Australian Food Composition Database is a well made and well documented free online database which provides data on a lot of typical foods that people eat all over the world.

### Overview

This is an investigation of dietary needs and what foods satisfy them. If you follow me on this data story, you with be interested and surprised by some information that is revealed.

I first will clean the data, then I investigate nutritional content of foods. I look at nutritional content statistically, and create a way to interpret micronutrient content. I graphically represent these findings and bring the story together. I then use and unsupervised machine learning technique, K-means clustering, to identify what food groups need to be eaten to achieve this nutrient complex.

I hope this story interests you as much as it did to me. Please provide feedback to my personal email: neverett2k11@gmail.com.

Thanks for reading!
