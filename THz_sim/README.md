# THz Simulation
This repository contains the THz STM Simulation. This project was made for use for the Cocker Group's Ultrafast Terahertz Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Lab at Michigan State University.

This project was made as a predictive model for Terahertz Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (THz-STM) measurements. The repository contains a series of jupyter notebooks. The main simulation, THz_STM_Simulation.ipynb, gives an extensive walkthrough of the process of hoe the algorithm works. Initially, great lengths are taken to simulate real physical data. Following that, the program deals with using real data (or simulated data) to apply a polynomial fit. 

Each section in the main simulation is explored in more detail in their corresponding notebooks.

In practice, the program can be applied to real data using THz_Sim.py.
